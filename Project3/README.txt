The whole project is organized as a ipynb file which can be directly run through Jupyter notebook or Google Colabortary.
For clarity, we organize the whole code separately according to the questions raised. 
Similar results as the project report shows can be attained through rerunning the file. 
Any questions about our implementation can be found through the code as well.
