The code here is zipped as an integrated pycharm project which can be directly run by Pycharm IDE. The
Console every computer itself owns may also have the ability to directly run this code even though we have not tried yet.

The main.py contains the whole code managing to solve questions asked in project 2. The same result as the report exhibits can be achieved by running this file
from the beginning.

The evaluation.py contains the function fits the model according to the training data given and provides 
corresponding visualization result and metrics evaluation for the clustering.

The preprocess.py contains the function to generate td-idf matrix and a function that defines the behavior of CountVectorizer by specifying the analyzer.
It also contains a Class to introduce different combination of transformation to the SVD and NMF method.
