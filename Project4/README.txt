The whole project is organized as a ipynb file which can be directly run through Jupyter notebook or Google Colabortary.
For clarity, we organize the whole code separately according to the questions raised. 
Moreover, to clear up the doubt about our result, we show one sample of the search result of different combiniation of hyperparmeters for each GridSearchCV in our code. 
These results can be found in the folder 'Result' in our zip file. 
Notice that there may be some difference between the result exhibited and the result after running our code because of randomness, which is a normal phenomenon allowed.
